## Overview

AutoCore simulation tool is developed based on Unity engine, which focuses help developer test Autoware functions. It could simulate multi type of input topics, so that the autonomous driving system could be tested.

## Requirement

### Simulator PC Requirement

OS: Windows 10  
CPU：Intel i5 9100 or higher  
GPU：GTX 750Ti or higher  
Memory：>8G  
Free disk：>1GB  

## Quick Start

### Start Simulator

1. Config Autoware ROS environment, launch Autoware runtime manager and rviz.

2. On windows PC download the simulator archive file, and extract it to a customized destination.

3. Double click `Simulator.exe` to run the simulator, enable all windows firewall dialogs.
  
4. Configure the ROS Master URI and ROS IP, and choose the driving scenario, then click launch.

5. Simulator will enter driving scenario and rviz will show maps.

6. Start `voxel_grid_filter` and `ndt_matching` for localization

7. Enable `vel_pose_connect` without `Simulation Mode`, lidar points will display.

8. Launch `op_global_planner`, drag a available goal in rviz.

9. Launch `op_local_planner`、 `pure_pursuit`、`twist_filter`, Simulator will start driving.  

## Simulator Instruction

There are some buttons on the top of the main interfaces:

1. Car Reset  
   Click to reset the ego car location to the default starting point.

2. Car Pose Set  
   Click to pick a location for ego car, then move the mouse to set the orientation.

3. Add Static Obstacle  
   Click to drop a obstacle at target place.

4. Add Human  
   Click to add a pedestrian at the target place, multiple pedestrians could be added via multiple clicks. Right click to finish. 

5. Add CarAI  
   Click to add a AI car at the target place, then click to add the destination for the AI car. AI car will run in the map according to the destination and follow traffic rules autonomously.

6. Remove All Obstacle  
   Click to remove all obstacles.

7. Settings  
   Click to open setting panel.

8. Exit Simu  
   To exit simulator and go back to the launch panel.
